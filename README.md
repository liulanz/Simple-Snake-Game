# Simple-Snake-Game
You can run this code by simply using visual studio.
After you run the code you will see "O" and "F" surrounded by "#".

"O" is snake's head.
"F" is the fruit.
"#" is used to represent fence.
"o" is snake's tail

Our goal is to move snake's head to the fruit and get points by pressing 'a,s,d,w' on the keyboard.
The game will stop if you enter "x" on the keyboard or if snake's head hits any segment of its tail.
